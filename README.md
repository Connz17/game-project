# js-game-project
This is my web browser game built on JavaScript, HTML, SCSS and CSS.
It contains 2 versions. 1 click based interaction and the other mouse based movement.
The game is a maze that you have to navigate to reach the exit within a set time limit, but also avoid bombs, thorn tiles and a trap exit.
You also have a set amount of HP that taking damage will reduce.
The game board updates with current information on what is taking place live in game
